# Agent graph

## Project

- Template: Next.js template
- Stack: Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- Package manager: pnpm 11 via Corepack

## Source map

- `src/app` contains thin App Router routes/layouts/providers; `src/modules/Home` owns the demo screen; `src/shared/ui/shadcn` owns registry primitives; shared hooks/libs/styles live under `src/shared/*`.
- `components.json`: shadcn registry and alias configuration. `src/shared/config/styles/palette.css` owns primitive colors and light/dark semantic mappings; `global.css` exposes them to Tailwind.
- `.ai/skills`: canonical project-local agent skills.
- `docs/AI_SKILLS.md`: skill selection and overlap notes.
- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: UI ownership and token rules.

## Flow and boundaries

- Default to Server Components. Keep `use client` at the narrowest interactive boundary. Use Route Handlers only for real server/BFF responsibilities.
- UI primitives -> reusable compositions -> feature/page composition.
- Environment values flow from ignored local `.env` files; only examples are committed.

## Commands

`pnpm dev`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm verify`.

## Impact hints

- Dependency/config change: install + lint/typecheck + build.
- UI primitive/theme change: check all consumers and run desktop/mobile browser smoke.
- Route/API/data change: verify direct route or contract plus build and focused tests.

## Codebase Memory MCP

- Resolve this checkout with list_projects using its actual repository root; index if missing/stale. Do not reuse a maintainer-specific project ID.

## Agent distribution

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: modular boundaries and rule precedence.
- `docs/AI_SKILLS.md`: installed skill profile.
- `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`: portable forwarding files to `.ai/skills`.

Codebase Memory MCP was refreshed during kit verification. Graph availability remains optional for community users; validate source freshness before later discovery.

## Required knowledge skills

- `.ai/skills/graphify`: focused relationship analysis; generated output in ignored `graphify-out/`.
- `.ai/skills/project-documentation-wiki`: business knowledge in `.wiki/`; read its index before substantive tasks.
- Canonical skills have portable forwarders for supported agent clients.

Installed workflow inventory and task triggers are listed in `docs/AI_SKILLS.md` and `.ai/workflows.json`. The frontend architecture follows the canonical app/modules/shared contract; verify source paths after future moves.

## Context routing

`.ai/workflows.json` (task/risk data) -> `.ai/context.mjs` (read-only route/contract validation) -> focused canonical skills. `.ai/WORKFLOW.md` owns the workflow/risk matrix; docs/AI_SKILLS.md is the inventory. Hub kit is the maintainer source for common files; copied projects run independently. No application imports the AI helper.

`.ai/skills/graphify/scripts/build_graph.py` is a pinned-version, scoped local AST adapter; `docs/GRAPHIFY.md` documents isolated installation. It writes only ignored graph/cache outputs and never invokes a semantic model API.

## URL-state extension

`docs/URL_STATE.md` owns state/filter policy. `docs/AI_SKILLS.md` and `.ai/workflows.json` index focused skills; hub kit is the shared authoring source, project copies stay standalone. `src/shared/libs/search-params.ts` defines URL parsers/loader/serializer; `src/shared/hooks/use-list-search.ts` uses nuqs; main/root layout supplies adapter; `scripts/query-state.test.mjs` tests normalization and serialization.
